# DevilSec Event Index

This repository contains an index of all upcoming DevilSec events in addition to a script which generates ICS files of all upcoming events.

The ICS files are referenced to in the [schedule page of the DevilSec website](https://devilsec.org/schedule).  


This repository is maintained by DevilSec's event planning team.  


## Index Files

### Events

The `events.json` is the index of all upcoming DevilSec events.  

All events are objects of an 'events' array.  
Each event object contains the following attributes: 
- Name: A string value which represents the name of the event.  
- Date: An ISO 8601 timestamp. It must at a minimum contain the date and the hour.  
- Duration: A duration value which can be any combination of days (`[0-9]*d`), hours (`[0-9]*h`), minutes (`[0-9]*m`) and seconds (`[0-9]*s`).  
- Location: A string value which represents the location of the event.  
- Location URL: A URL that represents the location of the event (i.e. Google Maps or OpenStreetMap, etc.).  
- Speakers: An array of speaker indexes which match a speaker in the Speakers index (`speakers.json). The array should be left empty if there are no speakers.  
- Category: An integer value representing the category, matching a category in the Category index (`category.json`).  
- Description: A string value representing the description of the event.  
- ICS URL: A string value representing the corresponding ICS file of the event. **This is automatically generated by the `icsgen.py` script.**  


### Speakers

The `speakers.json` is an index of speakers which either will speak or have spoken at a DevilSec event.

All speakers are objects of a 'speakers' array.   
Each speaker object contains the following attributes:  
- ID: An integer value representing a unique ID of a speaker.  
- Name: A string value representing the name of a speaker.   
- Description: A string value representing a short description of a speaker. **This value is currently unused.**   


## Categories

The `categories.json` is an index of categories which events are part of.

All categories are objects of a 'categoroies' array.   
Each category object contains the following attributes:  
- ID: An integer value representing a unique ID of a category.
- Name: A string value representing the name of the category.
